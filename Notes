How to use

Save the file as replay_runner.py in your project root.

Ensure you have dependencies installed (same as before):

python -m pip install fastapi uvicorn yfinance pydantic httpx


(You likely have these from the starter.)

Run your FastAPI app in one terminal:

python app.py


In another terminal run the replay script:

python replay_runner.py


Open http://localhost:8000/ — the frontend polls /inplay and will show the tickers and play the beep when it sees new rows.
